#Goal: Find storage accounts that store large amounts of data in the hot tier but have very low read access, 
#suggesting that data could be moved to cooler or archive tiers for cost savings.

#Checks if the storage account has lots of data (e.g., over 500GB) in the default (hot) tier.
#Ensures that egress (read activity) is low, indicating that data might be suitable for cooler or archive storage.
#Notifies team members to consider transitioning data to cheaper tiers.
